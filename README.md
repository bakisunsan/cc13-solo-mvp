This was created during my time as a student at Code Chrysalis‚Äù.

This is the project to learn fullstack development.

## User Story
- as a software developer, I want to create kanban for task management
- as a software development team, we want to add post-its to Kanban, multiple members at the same time
- as a software development team, we want to be able to easily operate post-it from my smartphone when we all operate it.
